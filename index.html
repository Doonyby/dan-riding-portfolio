  		<h2>About Me</h2>
  		<p>Hi, I'm Dan.  I'm a full stack javascript web developer.  I come from a multidisciplinary background and I am very excited to have finally landed in the incredible world of web development.  I quickly fell in love with the forever expansion and evolution of web development that provides me with endless learning and building opportunities.</p>
      <p>I recently graduated from the Full Stack Web Development course at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>.  I have found the problem solving of programming, and the process of making ideas come to reality extremely enjoyable.  I am genuinely inspired by the selfless geniuses that contribute to open-source code, and dream of following in their footsteps.</p>

          <h3>Inside Book Club</h3>
          <h4>A more thoughtful social network for the bookworm in you.</h4><br>
          <p>Isn't a book club best as a smaller group of people that can enjoy one another's company and talk about books together?  Inside Book Club is a way to accomplish this online and provide a space to host these  clubs remotely.</p> 
          <p>Inside Book Club was designed with a more exclusive approach to social media.  It helps people connect on a smaller scale and bypass comment feeds loaded with tedious opinions from people you don't care about.</p>  
          <p>Inside Book Club was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React.js and Redux.</p>

          <h3>Back Country Ski Buddy</h3>
          <h4>A meetup designed for the powder fiends of the Utah back country.</h4><br>
          <p>Back Country Ski Buddy allows a user to connect with other people in their community with skill levels appropriate for their planned outings.</p> 
          <p>Traveling alone in the back country can be extremely dangerous due to avalanche hazards. This app promotes safe practices by facilitating touring companionships.</p>
