  		<h2>About Me</h2>
  		<p>Hi, I'm Dan.  I'm a full stack javascript web developer.  I come from a (multidisciplinary) background that is too random for comfort and am excited to have finally landed in the inspiring world of web development.  I fell in love with the forever expansion and evolution of web development that provides me with endless learning and building (opportunities that it brings).  I love new and efficient ways to get around in programming and I find open-source code (genuinely inspired).  My dream is to one day follow in the footsteps of the geniuses that have made my life easier by contributing to the ocean of open-source information.  Please hire me!!!! </p>

  		<h3>Inside Book Club</h3>
      <h4>One sentence discription (a more thoughtful social network)</h4>
      <p>Project Description</p>
  		<p>This app was designed with a more exclusive approach to social media in mind.  The goal was to not have the whole world sharing opinions with you.  The nature of a book club is usually a smaller group of people that can enjoy and talk about books together.  This app is a way to accomplish that online and give the opportunity to host these exclusive clubs remotely.  Inside Book Club was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React.js and Redux.</p>
      <p>another two or three sentence paragraph</p>

  		<h3>Back Country Ski Buddy</h3>
  		<p>Back Country Ski Buddy is a way to promote safe practices in Utah back country usage.  Too many people use the back country alone which can be extremely dangerous when it comes to avalanche safety.  Back Country Ski Buddy allows a user to find other people in their back country community with specific skill levels appropriate for a planned outing.  This app was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Jquery.</p>

  		<h3>Map My Elevation</h3>
  		<p>Map My Elevation was originally made to be for the road biking community, but can be used by runners, motorists, or any other individual who's curious about elevation during a specific route.  A user can quickly type in starting and ending points to see that kind of ride they are in for.  It uses mapquest.com's API as well as Jquery and Ajax.</p>
