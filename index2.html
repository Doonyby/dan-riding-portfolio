About Me

Hi, I'm Dan.  I come from a background that is too random for comfort and am glad to have finally landed in the amazing world of code.  I fell in love with the forever expansion and evolution of web development that provides a  life long learning opportunity.  I love new and efficient ways to get around in development and I always look forward for opportunities to give back.  I have aI love the vision that comes with being a part of the coding world which is a huge ocean of information that everyone contributes a little part to it.

  I learned that here was a field full of completely selfless geniuses who are extremely anxious to share their secrets for the shear benefit of helping others on the same path.  I couldn't comprehend a field where people seemed almost more anxious to share their knowledge and experience with everyone else than they were to use it for their own benefit.  I couldn't believe the resources that exist that incredible developers were just throwing out there to the world.  I wanted to get good at it so that I could participate and contribute to the possibilities and potential that exist online.    I quickly learned and grew to love the concept that with open-source code, possibilities are endless.  Building cool things and sharing my knowledge with others.  These are two dreams that can both come true with coding.  

Projects

Inside Book Club

This app was designed with a more exclusive approach to social media in mind.  The goal was to not have the whole world sharing opinions with you.  The nature of a book club is usually a smaller group of people that can enjoy and talk about books together.  I built this app as a way to form that smaller club, but be able to do so online.  Inside Book Club was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React.js and Redux.

Back Country Ski Buddy

Back Country Ski Buddy is a way to promote safe practices in Utah back country usage.  Too many people use the back country alone which can be extremely dangerous when it comes to avalanche safety.  Back Country Ski Buddy allows a user to find other people in their back country community with specific skill levels appropriate for a planned outing.  This app was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Jquery.

Map My Elevation

Map My Elevation was originally made to be for the road biking community, but can be used by runners, motorists, or any other individual who's curious about elevation during a specific route.  A user can quickly type in starting and ending points to see that kind of ride they are in for.  It uses mapquest.com's API as well as Ajax and Jquery.
