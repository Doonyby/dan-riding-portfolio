About Me

With no clear direction in life at age 29, I took to career searching and interviewing professionals in fields that I had not yet researched.  With a degree in EMS and wilderness rescue, and a work background in tile and social work, I was in no way prepared, or heading in a direction to which I could secure a career that would provide a living for a family and challenge me with a continual opportunity to progress as far as I could take it.  I was sick of the conventional education system with specific requirements of time and subjects.  I felt like too much of my previous degree was headed in the wrong direction, and it ended in dissappointment when I failed to enter grad school after two separate attempts.  My enthusiasm for that world fizzled and the vision of a future in it became too complicated and strict.  I quickly gained the attitude that too much of this world is held back by red tape and how reaching a satisfactory state of living is impossible without having the certification, permission, or paper to allow whatever you're trying to do.  With my personality being a jack of all trades, I was looking for something that my progression and efforts could get me somewhere.  I started exploring more blue collar possibilities as a way to get progression and see the benefits of the work that I would put in.  Having a background in tile, the appeal to blue collar results was familiar and enticing.  However, many blue collar fields are not as mentally challenging as I'd like them to be.  During my search for what I should do with my life, I had a friend put a new perspective on the web development field.  He said that it was a field for builders, problem solvers, and people that like to tinker with the mechanics of something to get it to work.  I decided I would mess around with some of the free resources that exist for web development and quickly found it as a new hobby/interest that I could really throw myself into.  My friend had told me about how he never ended up going through any schooling to be where he was at today outside of an internship at Apple.  I instantly fell in love with the idea that coding can be a self-paced learning and merrit based field of opportunity.  As I continued deeper into coding, I began to feel that the challenge I believe in a life long learning process and getting results out of your work instead of having to jump through hoops and pay money to buy my rights to progress.  I decided to persue a career in web development.  The more I experienced, the more I found to enjoy about it.  I learned that here was a field full of completely selfless geniuses who are extremely anxious to share their secrets for the shear benefit of helping others on the same path.  This blew me away.  I couldn't comprehend a field where people seemed almost more anxious to share their knowledge and experience with everyone else, than they were to use it for their own benefit.  I couldn't believe the resources that exist that incredible developers were just throwing out there to the world.  Programming was an endless and rapidly expanding and evolving.  I wanted to be a part of that!  I wanted to get good at it so that I could participate and contribute to the possibilities and potential that exist online.  I love the overarching vision that comes with being a part of the coding world which is a huge ocean of information that everyone contributes a little part to it.  I quickly learned and grew to love the concept that with open-source code, possibilities are endless.  Everyone helping everyone out is a beautiful utopian concept that exists in the open-source world that I want to be a part of. Building cool things and sharing my knowledge with others.  These are two dreams that can both come true with coding.  

Projects

Inside Book Club

This app was designed with a more exclusive approach to social media in mind.  The goal was to not have the whole world sharing opinions with you.  The nature of a book club is usually a smaller group of people that can enjoy and talk about books together.  I built this app as a way to form that smaller club, but be able to do so online.  Inside Book Club was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React.js and Redux.

Back Country Ski Buddy

Back Country Ski Buddy is a way to promote safe practices in Utah back country usage.  Too many people use the back country alone which can be extremely dangerous when it comes to avalanche safety.  Back Country Ski Buddy allows a user to find other people in their back country community with specific skill levels appropriate for a planned outing.  This app was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Jquery.

Map My Elevation

Map My Elevation was originally made to be for the road biking community, but can be used by runners, motorists, or any other individual who's curious about elevation during a specific route.  A user can quickly type in starting and ending points to see that kind of ride they are in for.  It uses mapquest.com's API as well as Ajax and Jquery.
