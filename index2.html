          <h3>Inside Book Club</h3>
          <h4>A more thoughtful social network for the bookworm in you.</h4>
          <p>Project Description</p>
          <p>Isn't a book club best enjoyed as a smaller group of people that can enjoy one another's company and talk about books together?  Inside Book Club is a way to accomplish this online and provide a space to host these exclusive clubs remotely.</p> 
          <p>Inside Book Club was designed with a more exclusive approach to social media in mind.  It helps people connect on a smaller scale and bypass comment feeds loaded with tedious opinions from people you don't care about.</p>  
          <p>Inside Book Club was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React.js and Redux.</p>

          <h3>Back Country Ski Buddy</h3>
          <p>Back Country Ski Buddy is a way to promote safe practices in Utah back country usage.  Too many people use the back country alone which can be extremely dangerous when it comes to avalanche safety.  Back Country Ski Buddy allows a user to find other people in their back country community with specific skill levels appropriate for a planned outing.  This app was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Jquery.</p>

          <h3>Map My Elevation</h3>
          <p>Map My Elevation was originally made to be for the road biking community, but can be used by runners, motorists, or any other individual who's curious about elevation during a specific route.  A user can quickly type in starting and ending points to see that kind of ride they are in for.  It uses mapquest.com's API as well as Jquery and Ajax.</p>
